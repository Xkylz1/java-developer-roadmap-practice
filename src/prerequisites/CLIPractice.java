	 *  In this CLIPractice.java file, you will learn how to compile a script and run it from a terminal.
	 *  Make sure you have installed a JDK as the development kit. (I use JDK 17 for by the time i'm making this project).
	 *  Inside this file there will be a main method that output 'I'm learning Java Programming' in your terminal.
	 *  Before you start compiling this file, type following command in your terminal:
	 *  $ java --version
	 *  If you see a JDK with version in it, then you are good to go.
	 *  But if you see error that mean it hasn't set properly. You need to figure it out by yourself.
	 *  After you confirmed, that your JDK has been installed we can start compile this file.
	 *  First, put this file anywhere in your system, and run:
	 *  $ javac CLIPractice.java
	 *  It will produce a file named 'CLIPractice.class' a bytecode version of our script that we can run. If there is no error, then you can start the program by:
	 *  $ java CLIPractice
	 *  You can exclude the file extension, it will run just fine, and you will see an output:
	 *  I'm learning Java Programming.
	 *  If you see it, congratulation, you just success run a java application. :D
